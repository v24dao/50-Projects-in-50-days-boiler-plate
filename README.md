## About the course

#### Why I am completing this course?

- To maintain a high level of familiarity with vanilla HTML & CSS, whilst working on other projects that use Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.
- To learn about new JavaScript concepts and to actively apply the JavScript concepts which I already know.

#### My approach to the projects in this course

In regards to the JavaScript portions of these projects, I aim to complete as much as possible without reference to the corresponding videos.

I shall utilise resources such as [google](https://www.google.co.uk), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and my own notes.

Upon completion of each project, I shall compare my solution with Brad's and write about:

- What I have learnt from the project
- Resources which have helped me (if any)
- Any plans for continued development

## About this Project

#### What I learned

- When using CSS pseudo selectors such as `::before`, we may need to set the content property to an empty string for it to function as intended. `content: ""`
- I learned about the `:disabled` CSS selector and the cursor option `:not-allowed`.

#### Useful resources

- [HTML attributes:disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)
- [Disable and enable a button in JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_pushbutton_disabled.asp)

#### Continued development

- I could apply the steps counter to a testimonial section of a website or to an Eccomerce site.
